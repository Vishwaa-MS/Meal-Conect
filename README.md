# Meal-Conect
- This hackathon project aims to address the issue of food wastage at events and functions by providing a platform where
NGOs can efficiently collect surplus food from organizers and beneficiaries.
- Through this website, organizers and beneficiaries can easily coordinate the donation of excess food, which will then be
distributed to those in need by partnering NGOs.
- This initiative not only reduces food wastage but also helps to alleviate hunger by repurposing surplus food for the
benefit of marginalized communities.
